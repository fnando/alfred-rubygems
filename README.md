You can use the following modifiers (when available):

- `enter`: Will open the Rubygems page for that package.
- `alt`: Will open the source code url.
- `ctrl`: Will open the home page url.
- `cmd`: Will open the documentation url.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
